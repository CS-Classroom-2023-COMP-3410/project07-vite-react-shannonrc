React Component Refactor Assignment
===

**Objectives**

In this assignment, you'll build on your existing multi-page React project by:

1. Refactoring your shopping cart into a reusable component.
2. Enhancing the user experience by making the cart visible on every page (when items are present).
3. Creating a dedicated "Cart" page, accessible via the navigation bar.

---

**Project Context**

You've already built a multi-page React site using Vite, featuring pages like `Home`, `Products`, and `Profile`. The `ProductsPage` includes a functional shopping cart.

Your team loves the cart and wants to make it a bigger part of the site!

**Assignment Requirements**

Update your existing project to meet the following criteria:

1. **Extract the shopping cart into a separate component**

   * Move the cart logic (e.g., items, add/remove functions) and UI into `components/ShoppingCart.jsx`.
   * Use props and state as needed to keep data flowing.

2. **Show the cart summary on every page if it has items**

   * Import and display the cart in a consistent location on every page.
   * Only display it if the number of items is greater than **zero**.

3. **Create a new "Cart" page**

   * Add a `CartPage.jsx` component in the `pages/` folder.
   * Display the full cart (same or expanded version of the component).
   * Allow users to modify or remove items here.

4. **Add a link to the cart page in the navigation bar**

   * Update your `Header.jsx` to include a "Cart" link.
   * Clicking it should switch to the `CartPage`.

**Hints & Suggestions**

* **Cart state should be lifted** to the `App.jsx` level so it can be shared across pages and passed to the `ShoppingCart` component via props.
* If you’re using an array to store cart items, a simple `cartItems.length > 0` check can control visibility.
* You might need to **add a new `case`** to your `renderPage()` switch statement in `App.jsx` to support the cart route.
* Bonus!: Display the total number of items in the cart in the nav bar (e.g., "Cart (3)").
